# Contributing

Don't edit this project directly because [~email](https://glitch.com/~email) is a production app. To contribute:

## Developing

1. Remix [~email](https://glitch.com/~email)

2. In your [local dev](https://github.com/FogCreek/Glitch) change `EMAIL_TEMPLATE_API` (in `puppet/hieradata/development/common.yaml`) to your remix url. Then trigger a full deploy in `sh/watch.sh` with `f`.

3. Use paw or similar to trigger emails to your dev api. For example, POSTing to `https://api.glitch.development/email/sendLoginEmail?emailAddress=my-email@glitch.com` or `https://api.glitch.development/teams/[team-id]/sendJoinTeamEmail`.

    - You'll need to include an auth header with your request `Authorization: user-persistent-token`
    - You might also need to override `RATE_LIMIT_PERIOD` in `email.ts` while developing.

4. You can see the emails sent from your dev env at [https://glitch.development/mailbox/](https://glitch.development/mailbox/).

### Testing layout and style changes

To test your email templates with *real email clients* (gmail, ios mail, etc.) you'll need to use the staging environment.

1. In your [local dev](https://github.com/FogCreek/Glitch) change `EMAIL_TEMPLATE_API` (in `puppet/hieradata/staging/common.yaml`) to your remix url. Commit this and merge it into the [`staging`](https://github.com/FogCreek/Glitch/tree/staging) branch.

2. Use paw or similar to trigger emails to the staging api. For example, POSTing to `https://api.staging.glitch.com/email/sendLoginEmail?emailAddress=my-email@glitch.com` or `https://api.staging.glitch.com/teams/[team-id]/sendJoinTeamEmail`.

    - Staging can only send email to whitelisted addresses, so ask DavidH to add your email(s) to the staging environment SES whitelist.

3. The emails will be sent to your email address.

## Deploying

Since this is a small microservice app with infrequent updates, the process is less hardcore than ~Community. 

1. Let everyone in #infrastructure know that you're working on email app updates, and make you know who else is working on it

2. Use the `swapDomains` api endpoint to make your remixed email app the new prod one. This part is the same as on ~Community

> This endpoint is undocumented. If you've never used it before, feel free to ask Jude, Pirijan or Emanuele for help

3. Use `Advanced Options â†’ Export to Github` to `FogCreek/email`. Then merge in the PR that's created
